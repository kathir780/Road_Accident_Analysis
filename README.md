# 🚧 Road Safety Analytics: Understanding Accident Patterns for Prevention Planning

## 📊 Project Summary

Road accidents remain a critical public health issue globally, causing extensive injuries and fatalities. This project leverages a multi-year dataset to analyze accident trends, identify high-risk scenarios, and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve road safety infrastructure and public policy. Using Excel and Power BI, this end-to-end analysis transforms raw data into impactful visual insights tailored for decision-makers and safety professionals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify **patterns and risk factors** associated with road accidents
- Understand the **impact of environmental, temporal, and vehicular conditions** on accident severity
- Provide **evidence-based recommendations** to policymakers, road users, and urban planners
- Develop a replicable analytical model for future road safety evaluations

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Despite various road safety regulations and awareness campaigns, accident rates remain high. A deeper understanding of **when, where, and why** accidents occur is needed to inform smarter interventions and reduce both the frequency and severity of crashes.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, pivot analysis, KPI segmentation, chart creation
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and data storytelling
- **Data Source**: Government-provided accident records (2021–2022)

---

## 📦 Dataset Highlights

- **Duration**: 2 years (2021–2022)
- **Size**: 2+ million rows
- **Key Features**:
  - Accident severity, date, time, speed limits
  - Vehicle and casualty types
  - Road conditions, lighting, weather
  - Urban vs Rural segmentation

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Excel)
2. **KPI Design**: Fatality rate, serious injury rate, total casualties
3. **Segmentation**: Month-wise, area-wise, vehicle-wise, and condition-wise
4. **Cross-tab Analysis** and trend discovery
5. **Power BI Dashboards** for interactive stakeholder insights
6. **Answering 8+ Key Research Questions** around safety, severity, and conditions

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Urban areas** reported more accidents, while **rural areas** showed higher fatality rates per accident.
- **Motorcycles** had the highest risk factor; **bicycles and agricultural vehicles** were among the safest.
- **Poor lighting**, **fog**, and **flooded roads** significantly increased accident severity in rural areas.
- **Fridays and Wednesdays** consistently saw the highest casualties.
- **30 mph zones** (urban) accounted for over 61% of all casualties.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### For Policymakers:
- Prioritize upgrades in **30 mph zones** and **rural road lighting**
- Launch **motorcycle-specific safety interventions**
- Improve infrastructure in **flood-prone** rural areas

### For Road Users:
- Avoid travel during **fog/high wind conditions**
- Be extra cautious on **Fridays and Wednesdays**

### For Future Research:
- Include **driver demographics**
- Analyze **road usage frequency**
- Use **machine learning** for predictive risk modeling
